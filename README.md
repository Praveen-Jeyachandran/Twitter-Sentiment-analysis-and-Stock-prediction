# Twitter-Sentiment-analysis-and-Stock-prediction
The datatset was taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omermetinn/tweets-about-the-top-companies-from-2015-to-2020
In this project, we apply sentiment analysis and machine learning principles to find the correlation between “public sentiment” and “market activity”. We use twitter data to predict public mood and use the predicted mood and previous days’ Dow Jones values to predict the stock market movements. We also do a comparative study of various Machine Learning Models in predicting such market movements.

We also extract tweets from specific locations and queries and implement this to get a better idea of which area affects the stock market more.

Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. A sentiment analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase.
We use Afinn Library to give sentiment score to tweets. Further we use Arima model and LSTM model to predict the kind of fluctuations in market.

Finally we visualize the results obtained from our study on a timeseries in a way that it effectively, efficiently, elegantly, accurately as well as meaningfully communicates the information
